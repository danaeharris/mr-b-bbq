Get Dad to give me reviews.



*2 ways to deploy a NextJS app:*

• npm build && npm export: create a static build of the website. (Netlify)
    • Every page gets built as an HTML page and hosted statically.
    • The only thing the server does is return HTML pages.
    • This export command is not in package.json by default.

• npm build: creates a dynamic build of the website. (Vercel)
    • Some pages are built statically and hosted statically.
    • Some pages are built dynamically, and the server runs code to fetch data for the page on every request.


* Domains and hosting:*

• Domain registrar: the company that sells you the domain. (GoDaddy)
    • Lets you specify nameservers.
    • Provide default nameservers (but they're bad).
• Nameserver: controls what your domain points to. (Cloudflare) 
    • Can do other cool stuff like caching.
    • Gives you an SSL certificate to do https://
    • Configure all the things your domain needs to point to, like...
        • A-record: (where does mrb-bbq.com go?) 
        • CNAME records for subdomains (www.mrb-bbq.com or customers.mrb-bbq.com)
        • MX records for email (hello@mrb-bbq.com)
• Hosting platform: origin server that serves your website. (Netlify, Vercel)
    • Give you instructions for how to point your nameservers to Netlify.
        • Usually this is an A-record (but sometimes a CNAME record)
            • An IP address like 12.4543.1233.0
